<h2>TOMMY TROT&#8217;S VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
</div>

<p>The little boy whose story is told here
lived in the beautiful country of
&#8220;Once upon a Time.&#8221; His name, as I
heard it, was Tommy Trot; but I think
that, maybe, this was only a nick-name.
When he was about your age, he had, on
Christmas Eve, the wonderful adventure
of seeing Santa Claus in his own country,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
where he lives and makes all the beautiful
things that boys and girls get at Christmas.
In fact, he not only went to see
him in his own wonderful city away up
toward the North Pole, where the snow
never melts and the Aurora lightens up the
sky; but he and his friend, Johnny Stout,
went with dogs and guns to hunt the great
polar bear whose skin afterwards always lay
in front of the big library fireplace in
Tommy&#8217;s home.
</p>
<p>This is the way it all happened.
</p>
<p>Tommy lived in a big house on top of
quite a high hill, not far from a town which
could be seen clearly from the front portico
and windows. Around the house was a large
lawn with trees and shrubbery in it, and at
the back was a big lot, in one corner of which
stood the stables and barns, while on the other
side sloped down a long steep hill to a little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
stream bordered with willows and maples
and with a tract of woodland beyond. This
lot was known as the &#8220;cow-pasture,&#8221; and
the woodland was known as the &#8220;wood-lot,&#8221;
while yet beyond was a field which
Peake, the farmer, always spoke of as the
&#8220;big field.&#8221; On the other side of the cow-lot,
where the stables stood, was a road
which ran down the hill and across the
stream and beyond the woods, and on the
other side of this road near the bottom of the
hill was the little house in which lived Johnny
Stout and his mother. They had no fields or
lots, but only a backyard in which there were
chickens and pigeons and, in the Fall, just
before Tommy&#8217;s visit to Santa Claus, two
white goats, named &#8220;Billy&#8221; and &#8220;Carry,&#8221;
which Johnny had broken and used to drive
to a little rough wagon which he had made
himself out of a box set on four wheels.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<p>Tommy had no brothers or sisters, and
the only cousins he had in town were little
girls younger than himself, to whom he
had to &#8220;give up&#8221; when any one was
around, so he was not as fond of them as
he should have been; and Sate, his dog,
a terrier of temper and humours, was about
his only real playmate. He used to play
by himself and he was often very lonely,
though he had more toys than any other boy
he knew. In fact, he had so many toys that
he was unable to enjoy any one of them very
long, and after having them a little while he
usually broke them up. He used to enjoy the
stories which his father read to him out of
Mother Goose and the fairy-books and
the tales he told him of travellers and
hunters who had shot lions and bears and
Bengal tigers; but when he grew tired of this,
he often wished he could go out in the street
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
and play all the time like Johnny Stout and
some of the other boys. Several times he
slipped out into the road beyond the cow-lot
to try to get a chance to play with
Johnny who was only about a year older
than he, but could do so many things
which Tommy could not do that he quite
envied him. It was one of the proudest
days of his life when Johnny let him come
over and drive his goats, and when he went
home that evening, although he was quite
cold, he was so full of having driven them
that he could not think or talk of anything
else, and when Christmas drew near, one of
the first things he wrote to ask Santa Claus
for, when he put the letter in the library fire,
was a wagon and a pair of goats. Even his
father&#8217;s statement that he feared he was too
small yet for Santa Claus to bring him such
things, did not wholly dampen his hope.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>He even began to dream of being able to
go out some time and join the bigger boys
in coasting down the long hill on the other
side from Johnny Stout&#8217;s, for though his
father and mother thought he was still
rather small to do this, his father had promised
that he might do it sometime, and
Tommy thought &#8220;sometime&#8221; would be
after his next birthday. When the heavy
snow fell just before Christmas he began
to be sorry that he had broken up the sled
Santa Claus had given him the Christmas
before. In fact, Tommy had never wanted a
sled so much as he did the afternoon two days
before Christmas, when he persuaded his
father to take him out again to the coasting
hill to see the boys coasting. There were
all sorts of sleds: short sleds and long sleds,
bob-sleds and flexible fliers. They held
one, two, three, and sometimes even half a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
dozen boys and girls&mdash;for there were girls,
too&mdash;all shouting and laughing as they went
flying down the hill, some sitting and some
lying down, but all flying and shouting, and
none taking the least notice of Tommy.
Sate made them take notice of him; for he
would rush out after the sleds, barking just
as if they had been cats, and several times
he got bowled over&mdash;once, indeed, he got
tangled up in the string of a sled and was
dragged squealing with fright down the
hill. Suddenly, however, Tommy gave a
jump. Among the sleds flying by, most of
them painted red, and very fine looking,
was a plain, unpainted one, and lying full
length upon it, on his stomach, with his
heels high in the air, was Johnny Stout,
with a red comforter around his neck, and
a big cap pulled down over his ears. Tommy
knew him at once.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look, father, look!&#8221; he cried, pointing;
but Johnny&#8217;s sled was far down the hill
before his father could see him. A few
minutes later he came trudging up the hill
again and, seeing Tommy, ran across and
asked him if he would like to have a ride.
Tommy&#8217;s heart bounded, but sank within
him again when his father said, &#8220;I am
afraid he is rather little.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;ll take care of him, sir,&#8221; said
Johnny, whose cheeks were glowing. Tommy
began to jump up and down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, father, please,&#8221; he urged. His
father only smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you are not so very big yourself,&#8221;
he said to Johnny.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Big enough to take care of him,&#8221; said
Johnny.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, father, he&#8217;s awful big,&#8221; chimed
in Tommy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221; laughed his father.
He turned to Johnny. &#8220;What is your name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Johnny, sir. I live down below your
house.&#8221; He pointed across toward his
own home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know him,&#8221; said Tommy proudly. &#8220;He
has got goats and he let me drive them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he can drive,&#8221; said Johnny, condescendingly,
with a nod, and Tommy was
proud of his praise. His father looked at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your sled strong?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I made it myself,&#8221; said
Johnny, and he gave the sled a good kick
to show how strong it was.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Tommy&#8217;s father. They
followed Johnny to the top of the slide,
and Tommy got on in front and his father
tucked his coat in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on and don&#8217;t be afraid,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid!&#8221; said Tommy contemptuously.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
Just then Johnny, with a whoop and a
push which almost upset Tommy, flung
himself on behind and away they went down
the hill, as Johnny said, &#8220;just ski-uting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tommy had had sledding in his own
yard; but he had never before had any
real coasting like this, and he had never
dreamed before of anything like the thrill
of dashing down that long hill, flying like
the wind, with Johnny on behind, yelling
&#8220;Look out!&#8221; to every one, and guiding so
that the sled tore in and out among the
others, and at the foot of the hill actually
turned around the curve and went far on
down the road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right,&#8221; said Johnny, and
Tommy had never felt prouder. His only
regret was that the hill did not tilt up the
other way so that they could coast back instead
of having to trudge back on foot.
</p>

<br />
</span>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></div>
<p>When they got back again to the top of
the hill, Tommy&#8217;s father wanted to know
if they had had enough, but Tommy told
him he never could have enough. So they
coasted down again and again, until at
length his father thought they had better
be going home, and Johnny said he had to
go home, too, &#8220;to help his mother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you help?&#8221; asked Tommy&#8217;s
father, as they started off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just little ways,&#8221; said Johnny.
&#8220;I get wood&mdash;and split it up&mdash;and go to
Mr. Bucket&#8217;s and get her things for her&mdash;draw
water and feed the cow, when we had
a cow&mdash;we ain&#8217;t got a cow now since our
cow died&mdash;and&mdash;oh&mdash;just a few little things
like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tommy&#8217;s father made no reply, and
Tommy, himself, was divided between wonder
that Johnny could call all that work
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
&#8220;just a few little things,&#8221; and shame that
he should say, &#8220;ain&#8217;t got,&#8221; which he, himself,
had been told he must never say.
</p>
<p>His father, however, presently asked,
&#8220;Who is Mr. Bucket?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know Mr. Bucket?&#8221; said
Johnny. &#8220;He keeps that grocery on Hill
Street. He gave me the box I made this
old thing out of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Tommy&#8217;s father, and turned
and looked the sled over again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was the matter with your cow?&#8221;
asked Tommy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Broke her leg&mdash;right here,&#8221; and Johnny
pulled up his trousers and showed just
where the leg was broken below the knee.
&#8220;The doctor said she must be killed, and so
she was; but Mr. Bucket said he could have
saved her if the &#8217;Siety would&#8217;ve let him.
He&#8217;d &#8217;a just swung her up until she got well.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked Tommy, much interested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What Society?&#8221; asked his father.
</p>
<p>Johnny answered the last question first.
&#8220;&#8216;Pervention of Cruelty,&#8217;&#8221; he said, shortly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Tommy&#8217;s father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know how she broke her leg,&#8221; said
Johnny.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did she break her leg?&#8221; inquired
Tommy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A boy done it. I know him and I know
he done it, and some day I&#8217;m going to catch
him when he ain&#8217;t looking for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not had a cow since?&#8221; inquired
Tommy&#8217;s father. &#8220;Then you do
not have to go and drive her up and milk
her when the weather is cold?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I would not mind that,&#8221; said
Johnny cheerily. &#8220;I&#8217;d drive her up if the
weather was as cold as Greenland, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
milk her, too, so I had her. I used to love
to feed her and I didn&#8217;t mind carryin&#8217; milk
around; for I used to get money for it for
my mother to buy things with; but now,
since that boy broke her leg and the &#8217;Siety
killed her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did not say what there was since; he
just stopped talking and presently Tommy&#8217;s
father said: &#8220;You do not have so
much money since?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir!&#8221; said Johnny, &#8220;and my mother
has to work a heap harder, you see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you work too?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;I sell papers
and clean off the sidewalk when there is
snow to clean off, and run errands for Mr.
Bucket and do a few things. Well, I&#8217;ve
got to go along,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got some
things to do now. I was just trying this old
sled over on the hill to see how she would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
go. I&#8217;ve got some work to do now&#8221;; and
he trotted off, whistling and dragging his
sled behind him.
</p>
<p>As Tommy and his father turned into
their grounds, his father asked, &#8220;Where did
he say he lived?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, I&#8217;ll show you,&#8221; said Tommy,
proud of his knowledge. &#8220;Down there
[pointing]. See that little house down in
the bottom, away over beyond the cow-pasture?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know he lives there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;ve been there. He&#8217;s got
goats,&#8221; said Tommy, &#8220;and he let me drive
them. I wish I had some goats. I wish
Santa Claus would bring me two goats
like Johnny&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which would you rather have? Goats
or a cow?&#8221; asked his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goats,&#8221; said Tommy, promptly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if Johnny would!&#8221; laughed his
father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, where is Greenland?&#8221; said
Tommy, presently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A country away up at the North&mdash;away
up in that direction.&#8221; His father pointed
far across the cow-pasture, which lay shining
in the evening light. &#8220;I must show it
to you on the map.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it very cold there?&#8221; asked Tommy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very cold in winter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colder than this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, because it is so far north that
the sun never gets up in winter to warm
it, and away up there the winter is just
one long night and the summer one long
day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s where Santa Claus comes
from,&#8221; said Tommy. &#8220;Do people live up
there?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;People called Eskimos,&#8221; said his father,
&#8220;who live by fishing and hunting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about them,&#8221; said Tommy.
&#8220;What do they hunt?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bears,&#8221; said his father, &#8220;polar bears&mdash;and
walrus&mdash;and seals&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, tell me about them,&#8221; said Tommy,
eagerly.
</p>
<p>So, as they walked along, his father told
him of the strange little, flat-faced people,
who live all winter in houses made of ice
and snow and hunted on the ice-floes for
polar bears and seals and walrus, and in the
summer got in their little kiaks and paddled
around, hunting for seals and walrus with
their arrows and harpoons, on the &#8220;pans&#8221;
or smooth ice, where every family of
&#8220;harps&#8221; or seals have their own private
door, gnawed down through the ice with
their teeth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could go there,&#8221; said Tommy,
his eyes gazing across the long, white glistening
fields with the dark border of the
woodland beyond and the rich saffron of
the winter sky above the tree-tops stretching
across in a border below the steelly
white of the upper heavens.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you do?&#8221; asked his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hunt polar bears,&#8221; said Tommy
promptly. &#8220;I&#8217;d get one most as big as the
library, so mother could give you the skin;
because I heard her say she would like to
have one in front of the library fire, and the
only way she could get one would be to give
it to you for Christmas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His father laughed. &#8220;All right, get a big
one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will have to give me a gun. A
real gun that will shoot. A big one&mdash;so
big.&#8221; Tommy measured with his arms out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
straight. &#8220;Bigger than that. And I tell
you what I would do. I would get Johnny
and we would hitch his goats to the sled
and drive all the way up there and hunt
polar bears, and I&#8217;d hunt for sealskins, too,
so you could give mother a coat. I heard
her say she wanted you to give her one.
Wouldn&#8217;t it be fine if I could get a great big
bearskin and a sealskin, too! I wish I had
Johnny&#8217;s goats!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have dogs up there to draw
your sled,&#8221; said his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right! After I got there I would get
Santa Claus to give me some,&#8221; said Tommy.
&#8220;But you give me the gun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His father laughed again. &#8220;Well, maybe&mdash;some
day,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Some day&#8217; is too far away,&#8221; said
Tommy. &#8220;I want to go now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so far away when you are my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
age,&#8221; said his father smiling. &#8220;Ah, there
is where the North Star is,&#8221; he said, pointing.
&#8220;You cannot see it yet. I will show
it to you later, so you can steer by it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the way Santa Claus comes,&#8221;
said Tommy, his eyes on the Northern
sky. &#8220;I am going to wait for him tomorrow
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know he does not bring things to
boys who keep awake!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know; but I won&#8217;t let him see me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As they trudged along Tommy suddenly
asked, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you wish, Father, Santa Claus
would bring Johnny a cow for his mother?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; said his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Like Cowslip or Rose or even old
Crumpled Horn?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Like our cows!&#8221; echoed his father, absently.
&#8220;Why, yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because they are all fine cows, you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
know. Peake says so, and Peake knows
a good cow,&#8221; said Tommy, proud of his
intimacy with the farmer. &#8220;I tell you
what I am going to do when I get home,&#8221;
he declared. &#8220;I am going to write another
letter to Santa Claus and put it in the chimney
and ask him to send Johnny a whole
lot of things: a cow and a gun and all sorts
of things. Do you think it&#8217;s too late for him
to get it now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It is pretty late,&#8221; said
his father. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you ask him to
send these things to Johnny when you
wrote your other letter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not think of it,&#8221; said Tommy,
frankly. &#8220;I forgot him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you ask only for yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. For little Sis and Mother and
Peake and one other, but I&#8217;m not going to
tell you who he is.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>His father smiled. &#8220;Not Johnny?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Tommy. &#8220;I forgot him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid I did, too,&#8221; said his father
slowly.  &#8220;Well, write another and try.
You can never tell. Trying is better than
crying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was two days before Christmas.
And the next afternoon Tommy went again
with his father to the coasting-hill to see
the boys and once more take a coast with
Johnny. But no Johnny was there and no
other boy asked Tommy if he wanted a ride.
So, they returned home much disappointed,
his father telling him more about the Eskimos
and the polar bears. But, just as they
were turning the corner before reaching the
gate which led into their grounds, they
came on Johnny struggling along through
the snow, under the weight of a big basket
full of bundles. At sight of them he swung
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
the basket down in the snow with a loud,
&#8220;Whew, that&#8217;s heavy! I tell you.&#8221; Tommy
ran forward to meet him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been looking for you,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not go to-day,&#8221; explained
Johnny. &#8220;I had to work. I am working
for Mr. Bucket to-day to make some money
to buy Christmas things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much do you make?&#8221; asked
Tommy&#8217;s father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Half a dollar to-day, if I work late. I
generally make ten cents, sometimes fifteen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a pretty heavy load&mdash;in the
snow,&#8221; said Tommy&#8217;s father, as Johnny
stooped and swung his basket up on his hip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can manage it,&#8221; said the boy,
cheerfully. &#8220;A boy stole my sled last night,
or I would carry it on that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stole your sled!&#8221; cried Tommy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I left it outside the door when I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
was getting my load to put on, and when I
came out it was gone. I wish I could
catch him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to watch for him, too,&#8221; said
Tommy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had a box I could make another
one,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;Maybe, Mr. Bucket
will give me one after Christmas. He said
maybe he would. Then I will give you another
ride.&#8221; He called over his shoulder to
them, as he trudged off, &#8220;Well, good-by.
I hope you will have a merry Christmas,
and that Santa Claus will bring you lots of
things,&#8221; and away he trudged. They wished
him a merry Christmas, too, and then turned
into their grounds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said Tommy, suddenly, &#8220;let&#8217;s
give Johnny a sled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said his father, &#8220;you might give
him yours&mdash;the one you got last Christmas.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got it now. It&#8217;s gone,&#8221; said
Tommy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did some one take it&mdash;like Johnny&#8217;s?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I broke it,&#8221; said Tommy, crestfallen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might mend it?&#8221; suggested his
father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I broke it all up,&#8221; said Tommy, sadly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that is a pity,&#8221; said his father.
</p>
<p>Tommy was still thinking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, why can&#8217;t I give him a box?&#8221;
he said. &#8220;The basement and the wood-shed
are full of big boxes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not give him the one I gave you
a few days ago?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I broke it up, too,&#8221; said Tommy shamefacedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said his father. &#8220;That&#8217;s a pity.
Johnny could have made a sled out of it.&#8221;
Tommy felt very troubled, and he began
to think what he might do.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you will give me another, I will give
it to Johnny,&#8221; he said presently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ll tell you what I will do,&#8221; said
his father. &#8220;I will furnish the box if you
will carry it over to Johnny&#8217;s home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I will do it,&#8221; said Tommy
promptly. So as soon as they reached
home Tommy dived down into the basement
and soon came out, puffing and blowing,
dragging along with him a big box as
high as his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid that is too big for you to
carry,&#8221; suggested his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I will make Richard carry it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Richard is my servant, not yours,&#8221; said
his father. &#8220;Besides, you were to carry it
yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too big for me. The snow is too
deep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if you had not broken up your
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
sled you might carry it on that,&#8221; said his
father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tommy sadly. &#8220;I wish I
had not broken it up. I&#8217;ll be bound that I
don&#8217;t break up the next one I get.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good beginning,&#8221; said his
father. &#8220;But wishing alone will never do
anything, not even if you had the magical
wishing-cap I read you about. You must
not only wish; you must help yourself.
Now, Johnny would make a sled out of
that box.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could,&#8221; said Tommy. &#8220;I
would try if I had some tools. I wish I had
some tools.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What tools would you need?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tommy thought a minute. &#8220;Why, a hammer
and some nails.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A hammer and nails would hardly
make a sled by themselves.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no. I wish I had a saw, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Santa Claus brought you all
these tools last Christmas?&#8221; suggested his
father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He did; but I lost them,&#8221; said Tommy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever hunt for them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some. I have hunted for the hammer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, suppose you hunt again. Look
everywhere. If you find any I might lend
you the others. You might look in my
lumber room.&#8221; Tommy ran off and soon
returned with a hammer and some nails
which he had found, and a few minutes later
his father brought a saw and a hatchet,
and they selected a good box, which
Tommy could drag out, and put it in the
back hall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Tommy, &#8220;what shall we
do next?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is for you to say,&#8221; said his father.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
&#8220;Johnny does not ask that question. He
thinks for himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we must knock this box to pieces,&#8221;
said Tommy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so, too,&#8221; assented his father.
&#8220;Very carefully, so as not to split the
boards.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, very carefully,&#8221; said Tommy, and
he began to hammer. The nails, however,
were in very tight and there was a strip of
iron along each of the edges, through which
they were driven, so it was hard work; but
when Tommy really tried and could not
get the boards off, his father helped him,
and soon the strips were off and the boards
quickly followed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what shall we do?&#8221; asked his
father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, we must make the sled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;but how?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, we must have runners and then
the top to sit on. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Go ahead,&#8221; said his father.
So Tommy picked up two boards and
looked at them. But they were square at
the ends.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must make the runners,&#8221; he said
sadly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you saw them for me?&#8221; asked
Tommy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if you will show me where to saw.&#8221;
Tommy pondered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; he said, and he ran off, and in a
moment came back with a picture of a sled
in a magazine. &#8220;Now make it this way,&#8221;
he said, showing his father how he should
saw the edges.
</p>
<p>He was surprised to see how well his
father could do this, and his admiration for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
him increased as he found that he could
handle the tools quite as well as Peake, the
farmer; and soon the sled began to look
like a real sled with runners, sawed true,
and with cross-pieces for the feet to rest on,
and even with a strip of iron, taken from
the edges of the boxes, carefully nailed on
the bottom of the runners.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Tommy cried, &#8220;Father, why
not give Johnny this sled?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The very thing!&#8221; exclaimed his father
with a smile. And Tommy felt quite proud
of having suggested it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish it had a place to hitch on the
goats,&#8221; said Tommy, thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s make one,&#8221; said his father; and
in a few minutes two holes were bored in
the front of the runners.
</p>
<p>It was now about dusk, and Tommy said
he would like to take the sled down to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
Johnny&#8217;s house and leave it at his door
where he could find it when he came home
from work, and, maybe, he might think
Santa Claus had brought it. So he and his
father went together, Tommy dragging the
sled and, while his father waited at the
gate, Tommy took the sled and put it in
the yard at the little side-door of Johnny&#8217;s
home. As they were going along, he said,
pointing to a small shed-like out-building
at the end of the little yard, &#8220;That&#8217;s the
cow-house. He keeps his goats there,
too. Don&#8217;t you wish Santa Claus would
bring his mother a cow? I don&#8217;t see
how he could get down that small chimney!&#8221;
he said, gazing at the little flue
which came out of the roof. &#8220;I wonder if
he does?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if he does?&#8221; said his father to
himself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>When Tommy slipped back again and
found his father waiting for him at the
gate, he thought he had never had so
fine a time in all his life. He determined
to make a sled for somebody every Christmas.

<p>When they reached home Tommy,
after warming his hands and telling
his mother about the sled, set to work
to write a letter to Santa Claus on behalf of
Johnny, and as he wrote, a number of
things came to him that he thought Johnny
would like to have. He remembered that
he had no gloves and that his hands were
very red; that his cap was very old and too
small for him; that a real flexible flier would
be a fine thing for him. Then, as he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
asked for a gun for himself to hunt polar
bears with and a fur coat to go out with in
the snow, he added these in Johnny&#8217;s letter
also; in fact, he asked for Johnny just the
things he had asked for himself, except the
goats, and, as Johnny had two goats, it was
not necessary to ask for them for him. Instead
of goats, however, he asked that Santa
Claus might give Johnny&#8217;s mother a cow,
as good as one of their cows. As he was
not a very rapid writer it took him some
time to write this letter, especially, as he did
not know how to spell a good many words,
and had to ask his mother how to spell
them, for his father had gone out soon after
their return from taking the sled to Johnny,
and immediately after showing him the
picture of the polar bear and the map of
the North-pole region. Then when the
letter was all done, signed and sealed,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
Tommy carefully dropped it in the fire
in the library, and watched it as it first
twisted up, then burst into a blaze, and
finally disappeared in flame and smoke up
the big chimney, hoping that it would blow
away like the wind to Santa Claus to catch
him before he started out that night on his
round of visits.
</p>
<p>By this time his supper was ready and he
found that he was very hungry. He had
no sooner finished it than he drew up in a
big chair by the warm fire, and began to
wonder whether Santa Claus would get his
letter in time, and, if so, what he would bring
Johnny. The fire was warm and his eyes
soon began &#8220;to draw straws,&#8221; but he did
not wish to go to bed quite yet and, indeed,
had a lingering hope that when his father
returned he might coax him into letting him
go out again and slide with Johnny and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
then, perhaps, stand a chance of seeing
Santa Claus come up the long hill, with his
reindeer flying like the wind over the snow
and taking the roofs of the houses with a
single bound. So he moved over to the sofa
where he could see better, and where it
would not be likely his sleepiness would be
observed.
</p>
<p>The last thing he recalled in the sitting-room
was when he parted the heavy curtains
at the foot of the sofa and looked out
at the snow stretching away down the hill
toward the woods, and shining in the light
of the great round moon which had just
come up over the side of the yard to the
eastward. Then he curled up in the corner
of the sofa as wide awake as a boy could be
who had made up his mind to keep awake
until midnight. The next thing he remembered
was Sate jumping up and snuggling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
by him, and the next was his father coming
in and telling him Johnny was waiting outside
with his sled and the two goats hitched
to it to take a long ride, and his wrapping
him up carefully in his heavy overcoat. In
a second he was out in the yard and made
a dash for the cow-lot, and there, sure
enough, was Johnny waiting for him at the
gate in the cow-pasture with a curious little
peaked cap on his head and his coat collar
turned up around his chin and tied with a
great red comforter, so that only his eyes
and nose peeped over it. As Tommy had
never seen Johnny with that cap on before,
he asked him where he had got it, and he
said he had swapped caps with a little old
man he had met driving a cow in the road
as he came home. He could not keep this
cap on his head, so Johnny had given him his
in place of it, as it fitted him very well. And
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
there were the two goats hitched to the very
sled Tommy had made. In a minute they
were on the sled, Tommy in front with the
reins and Johnny sitting behind. Just as
they were about to start, to Tommy&#8217;s horror,
out came Sate, and do as they might,
Sate would not go back; but jumped up on
the sled and settled down at Tommy&#8217;s feet,
and as Johnny said he did not mind and
that Sate would keep Tommy&#8217;s feet warm,
they let him stay, which proved in the end
to be a very fortunate thing. Just after they
had fixed themselves comfortably, Johnny
said, &#8220;Are you ready?&#8221; &#8220;Ready!&#8221; said
Tommy, and gathered up the reins, and the
next moment the goats started off, at first
at a walk and then at a little trot, while
Tommy was telling Johnny what his father
had told him about the night in Santa
Claus&#8217;s country being so long that sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
the sun did not rise above the horizon for
several months.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s as long as that,&#8221; said Johnny, &#8220;we
might go and see the old fellow and get
back before midnight? I wish we could go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; said Tommy, &#8220;but I&#8217;m afraid
we might not find our way.&#8221; He remembered
just then that all one had to do was to
steer by the North Star, and at that moment
he caught sight of the star right over
the goats&#8217; heads.
</p>
<p>The coast was clear and the snow was
up to the top of the fences. The moon
made it as light as day and never again
would there be such a chance. It came to
him, too, that on the map all the lines ran
together at the North Pole, so that one
could hardly miss his way, and if he should,
there were Eskimos to guide him. So when
Johnny said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go and try,&#8221; he agreed,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
for if they once got there, Santa Claus,
himself, might bring them back with him.
</p>
<p>For a moment they went along as though
they were coasting down a hill, with the
little North Star shining directly in front
of them as they glided along.
</p>
<p>Just then Tommy said, &#8220;I wish the goats
were reindeer. Let&#8217;s pretend they are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; said Johnny.
</p>
<p>At this instant something happened; the
goats gave a jump which sent a cloud of
fine snow up into the boys&#8217; faces; the sled
gave a great leap and on a sudden they
began to tear along like the wind. The
snow-fields flew by them, and the trees,
standing up to their knees in snow, simply
tore along to the rear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are running away!&#8221; said Tommy,
as soon as he could catch his breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Let them run,&#8221; said Johnny.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
&#8220;But steer by the North Star.&#8221; And so
they did.
</p>
<p>When the cloud of snow in their faces
cleared away, Tommy could scarcely believe
his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, Johnny!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;They are
real reindeer. Real live ones. Look at
their antlers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;That little
man said he wanted to swap with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So they flew on, up hill and down dale,
over fields of white snow where the fences
and rocks were buried and the cuts were
filled up level; down frozen streams, winding
through great forests where the pines
were mantled with white; in between great
walls of black rock towering above them,
with the stars shining down like fires; out
again across the vast stretches of snow with
the Pole Star ever twisting and turning and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
coming before them again, until the sky
seemed lit up with wonderful colours, and
great bands of light were shooting up and
sinking down only to shoot up again with
a crackling like packs of pop-crackers in the
distance.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_3' id='linki_3'></a>
<img src='images/c003.jpg' width='400' height='593' alt='' title='' /><br />
<span class='caption'>
They flew on, over fields of white snow.
<br />
</span>
</div>

<p>The wind sang in their ears, nipped their
noses, and made Tommy drowsy, and
presently he must have fallen asleep; for
just as he was conscious that Johnny had
taken the reins, and, with one arm on either
side of him was holding him on his shoulder,
there was a great jolt and a sort of
crash as of breaking through. He would
have fallen off the sled if Johnny had not
held him tight.
</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes they seemed to
be passing through a sort of silvery haze,
as though the moonlight were shining
through a fine mist of silvery drops which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
shed the softest radiance over everything.
And suddenly through this enchanting light
they came to a beautiful city, with walls
around it of crystal, all rimmed with gold,
like the clouds at sunset. Before them was
a great gate through which shone a wonderful
light, and inside they saw a wide street
all lit up. As they reached the gate there
was a sort of peal, as of bells, and out poured
a guard of little men in uniform with little
swords at their sides and guns in their
hands, who saluted, while their officer, who
had a letter in his hand, halted them with
a challenge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who goes there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends,&#8221; said Tommy, standing up and
saluting, as he had seen soldiers do at the fort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Advance, friends, and give the countersign.&#8221;
Tommy thought they were lost
and his heart sank.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>But Johnny said, &#8220;&#8216;Good-will.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the captain and stepped
back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who gave you that sled?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tommy,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;This little
boy here made it and gave it to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the one,&#8221; said the captain to a
guard, looking at a letter in his hand. &#8220;Let
them by.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They drove in at the gate and found
themselves in a broad street filled with enchanting
things more beautiful than Tommy
had ever dreamed of. The trees which
lined it were Christmas trees, and the
lights on them made the street as bright
as noonday.
</p>
<p>Here the reindeer slackened their pace,
and as they turned down the great street
they could see through the windows rooms
brilliantly lighted, in which were hosts of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
people bustling about as busy as bees, working
at Christmas things of all sorts and
descriptions. They suddenly came to the
gate of a great palace-like place, which the
reindeer appeared to know, for they turned
in at the gate just as Tommy&#8217;s father&#8217;s
horses always turned in at their gate at
home, and as they drove up to the door,
with a shout of, &#8220;Here they are!&#8221; out
poured a number of the same little people&mdash;like
those they had already seen at the
gate. Some helped them out, some stood
like a guard, and some took their reindeer
to drive them to the stable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are just in time,&#8221; said the captain
of this party, as he stepped forward and
saluted them. &#8220;The old Gentleman has
been waiting for you, sending out to the
gate to watch for you all evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tommy was about to ask, &#8220;How did he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
know we were coming?&#8221; but before he
could get the words out, the little man said,
&#8220;Oh, he knows all that boys do, especially
about Christmas time. That&#8217;s his business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; thought Tommy, &#8220;I shall have to
mind what I even think up here. He answers
just as if I had said it. I hope he
knows what I want for Christmas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait and see,&#8221; said the little man; and
Tommy, though he was glad to hear it, determined
not to think any more just then,
but he was sorry he had not thought to wish
for more things while he was wishing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t worry about that,&#8221; said the
guard. &#8220;Santa Claus doesn&#8217;t care much
what you ask for for yourself. Even if he
gives those things, you soon get tired of
them or lose them or break them up. It
is the things one asks for for others that
he gives pleasure with. That&#8217;s the reason
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
he has such a good time himself, because he
gives all the things to others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tommy tried to think what he had ever
given to any one. He had given pieces of
candy and cake when he had plenty, but
the sled was the only thing he had ever
really given. He was about to mention this
when the guard mentioned it for him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that sled was all right,&#8221; he said,
with a little nod. &#8220;Come in,&#8221; and the great
ice-doors opened before them, and in they
walked.
</p>
<p>They passed through a great hall, all ice,
as transparent as glass, though curiously it
was warm and dry and filled with every
kind of Christmas &#8220;things:&#8221;&mdash;everything
that Tommy had ever seen, and a myriad
more that he had never dreamed of. They
were packed and stacked on either side,
and a lot of little people, like those he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
already seen, were working among them,
tossing them about and shouting to each
other with glee to &#8220;Look out,&#8221; just as the
boys did when coasting on the hill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you,&#8221; said one, &#8220;the Governor will
have a busy time to-night. It beats last
Christmas.&#8221; And he made a run and a
jump, and lit on a big pile of bundles which
suddenly toppled over with him and nearly
buried him as he sprawled on the slippery
floor. This seemed a huge joke to all the
others and they screamed with laughter at
&#8220;Old Smartie,&#8221; as they called him, and
poured more bundles down on him, just as
though they were having a pillow-fight.
Then when Old Smartie had at last gotten
on his feet, they had a great game of tag
among the piles and over them, and the
first thing Tommy knew he and Johnny
were at it as hard as anybody. He was very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
proud because Johnny could jump over piles
as high as the best of them. Tommy, himself,
however, could not jump; for they led him
to a pile so high that he could not see over
it; and on top were the fragments of all the
things he had ever had and had broken up.
He could not help crying a little; but just
then in dashed a number of little men and
gathering them up, rushed out with them.
Tommy was wondering what they were
going to do with them, when his friend, the
guard, said: &#8220;We mend some of them;
and some we keep to remind you with.
Now try again.&#8221; Tommy tried and did
very well, only his left foot had gone to sleep
in the sled and had not quite waked up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was because Sate went to sleep
on it,&#8221; said his friend, the guard, and
Tommy wondered how he knew Sate&#8217;s
name.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said the guard, &#8220;we have to know
dogs&#8217; names to keep them from barking at us
and waking everybody up. Let me lend you
these boots,&#8221; and with that he kicked off his
boots. &#8220;Now, jump,&#8221; and Tommy gave
a jump and lit in them, as he sometimes
did in his father&#8217;s shoes. No sooner had
Tommy put them on than he found that
he could jump over the highest pile in the
room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, look!&#8221; cried several of the others.
&#8220;The captain has lent that little boy his
&#8216;Seven Leaguers.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know where he is going,&#8221; said one;
&#8220;to jump over the North Pole.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; laughed another. &#8220;He is going
to catch the cow that &#8216;jumped over the
moon,&#8217; for Johnny Stout&#8217;s mother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Just then a message came that &#8220;Old
Santa,&#8221; as they called him, was waiting to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
see the two boys who had come in the new
box-sled, as he wanted to know how their
mothers were and what they wished for
Christmas. So there was a great scurrying
to get their heads brushed before the bell
rang again, and Tommy got soap in his
eyes wetting the brush to make his hair lie
smooth, while Johnny&#8217;s left shoe came off
and dropped in a hole in the floor. Smartie,
however, told him that that was for the
&#8220;Old Woman who lived in a shoe&#8221; to feed
her cow in, and this was considered a great
joke.
</p>
<p>The next minute the door opened and
they entered a great apartment, filled with
the softest light from a blazing fire, and
Tommy was sure it was his father&#8217;s back
before him at the fireplace; but when the
man turned it was Santa Claus, only he did
not have on his whiskers, and looked ever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
so much younger than in his pictures. At
first he did not even look at them, he was
so busy receiving mail that came fluttering
down the chimney in a perfect snowstorm.
As the letters came he gathered them up
and handed them to a lady who was seated
on the floor, saying, &#8220;Put that in,&#8221; to
which the lady always answered, &#8220;Just
the thing,&#8221; in a voice so like his mother&#8217;s
that Tommy felt quite at home. He was
just wondering when &#8220;Sometime&#8221; would
come, when Santa Claus picked up a letter,
which had been thrown on the floor, and
tossed it to the lady, saying, &#8220;Here&#8217;s that
letter from that little boy, Tommy Trot.
Put some of those things in so he can break
them up. He asked only for himself and
much joy he will get out of them.&#8221; Tommy
shrank back behind Johnny. He wanted
to say that he had written another letter to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
ask for things for others, but he had lost
his tongue. Just then, however, Santa
Claus put up his hand and pulled out another
letter.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_4' id='linki_4'></a>
<img src='images/c004.jpg' width='400' height='597' alt='' title='' /><br />
<span class='caption'>
&#8220;Look, Look! The captain has lent that little boy his<br />
&#8216;Seven Leaguers.&#8217;&#8221;
<br />
</span>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, as he glanced at it,
&#8220;this is more like it. He is improving. I see
he has asked for a lot of things for a friend
of his named Johnny. Johnny Stout&mdash;who
is he? It seems to me I hardly remember
him or where he lives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Johnny, stepping up.
&#8220;That&#8217;s me. He gave me a sled, too, and
he made it himself.&#8221; Santa Claus turned
and looked at him and his expression
turned to a smile; in fact, Tommy thought
he really winked at Johnny.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know that sled. It was a pretty
good sled, too,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>This gave Tommy courage, and he
stepped forward and said, &#8220;He lives in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
little bit of a house near our place&mdash;just that
way&mdash;&#8221; He turned and pointed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
show it to you when you come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Santa Claus. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show
it to you and you show it to me. We are
apt to overlook those little houses. So you
are Tommy Trot?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Glad to see
you,&#8221; and he turned and held out his hand
to Tommy. &#8220;I sent my reindeer to fetch
you and I am glad you made that sled, for
it is only a sled made for others that can
get up here. You see, everything here,
except the North Pole, is made for some
one else, and that&#8217;s the reason we have such
a good time up here. If you like, I&#8217;ll take
you around and show you and Johnny our
shops.&#8221; This was exactly what Tommy
wanted, so he thanked him politely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be back in a little while,&#8221; said Santa
Claus to the lady, &#8220;for as soon as the boys
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
are all asleep I must set out. I have a great
many stockings to fill this year. See that
everything is ready. Come along, boys,&#8221;
and next minute they were going through
room after room and shop after shop, filled
with so many things that Tommy could not
keep them straight in his mind. He wondered
how any one could have thought of
so many things, except his mother, of
course; she always thought of everything
for everyone. Some of them he wished
for, but every time he thought of wanting
a thing for himself the lights got dim, so
that he stopped thinking about himself at
all, and turned to speak to Johnny, but he
was gone.
</p>
<p>Presently Santa Claus said: &#8220;These are
just my stores. Now we will go and see
where some of these things are made.&#8221; He
gave a whistle, and the next second up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
dashed a sled with a team of reindeer in it,
and who was there holding the reins but
Johnny, with his little cap perched on the
top of his head! At Tommy&#8217;s surprise
Santa Claus gave a laugh that made him
shake all over like a bowl full of jelly, quite
as Tommy had read he did in a poem he
had learned the Christmas before, called
&#8220;The Night Before Christmas, when all
through the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That comes of knowing how to drive
goats,&#8221; said Santa Claus. &#8220;Johnny knows
a lot and I am going to give him a job,
because he works so hard,&#8221; and with that
Tommy&#8217;s boots suddenly jumped him into
the sled, and Santa Claus stepped in behind
him and pulled up a big robe over
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here goes,&#8221; he said, and at the word
they turned the corner, and there was a gate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
of ice that looked like the mirrored doors
in Tommy&#8217;s mother&#8217;s room, which opened
before them, and they dashed along between
great piles of things, throwing them
on both sides like snow from a sled-runner,
and before Tommy knew it they were gliding
along a road, which Tommy felt he had
seen somewhere before, though he could not
remember where. The houses on the roadside
did not seem to have any front-walls at
all, and everywhere the people within were
working like beavers; some sewing, some
cutting out, some sawing and hammering,
all making something, all laughing or
smiling. They were mostly dressed like
grown-up people, but when they turned
their faces they all looked young. Tommy
was wondering why this was, when Santa
Claus said that was because they were
&#8220;Working for others. They grow young
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
every Christmas. This is Christmas Land
and Kindness Town.&#8221; They turned another
corner and were whisking by a little
house, inside of which was some one sewing
for dear life on a jacket. Tommy knew the
place by the little backyard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop, stop!&#8221; he cried, pointing. &#8220;That&#8217;s
Johnny&#8217;s home and that&#8217;s Johnny&#8217;s mother
sewing. She&#8217;s laughing. I expect she&#8217;s
making that for Johnny.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Santa Claus, turning.
Tommy pointed back, &#8220;There, there!&#8221; but
they had whisked around a corner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so busy looking at that big house
that I did not see it,&#8221; said Santa Claus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s our house,&#8221; said Tommy. &#8220;I
tell you what,&#8221; he said presently, &#8220;if I get
anything&mdash;I&#8217;ll give him some.&#8221; Santa
Claus smiled.
</p>
<p>So they dashed along, making all sorts of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
turns and curves, through streets lined with
shops full of Christmas things and thronged
with people hurrying along with their arms
full of bundles; out again into the open; by
little houses half buried in snow, with a
light shining dimly through their upper
windows; on through forests of Christmas
trees, hung with toys and not yet lighted,
and presently in a wink were again at
Santa Claus&#8217;s home, in a great hall. All
along the sides were cases filled with all
sorts of toys, guns, uniforms, sleds, skates,
snow-shoes, fur gloves, fur coats, books,
toy-dogs, ponies, goats, cows, everything.

<p>Tommy was just thinking how he
would love to carry his mother a polar
bearskin for his father, and his father a
sealskin coat for his mother, when Santa
Claus came up behind him and tweaked
his ear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he said, &#8220;so you want something&mdash;something
you can&#8217;t get?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for myself,&#8221; said Tommy, shamefacedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; said Santa Claus, with a look much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
like Tommy&#8217;s father when he was pleased.
&#8220;I know that. They don&#8217;t have them exactly
about here. The teddy-bears drove
them out. You have to go away off to find
them.&#8221; He waved his hand to show how
far off it was.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to hunt them, if I only
had a gun!&#8221; said Tommy;&mdash;&#8220;and one for
Johnny, too,&#8221; he added quickly.
</p>
<p>Santa Claus winked again. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he
said slowly, just as Tommy&#8217;s father always
did when Tommy asked for something and
he was considering&mdash;&#8220;well, I&#8217;ll think about
it.&#8221; He walked up and touched a spring, and
the glass door flew open. &#8220;Try these guns,&#8221;
he said; and Tommy tipped up and took
one out. It, however, seemed a little light
to shoot polar bears with and he put it
back and took another. That, however,
was rather heavy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Try this,&#8221; said Santa Claus, handing
him one, and it was the very thing. &#8220;Load
right; aim right; and shoot right,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;and you&#8217;ll get your prize every time. And,
above all, stand your ground.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if I only had some dogs!&#8221; thought
Tommy, looking around at a case full of
all sorts of animals; ponies and cows; and
dogs and cats; some big, some little, and
some middle-sized. &#8220;I wish those were
real dogs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Sate?&#8221; asked Santa Claus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sate can&#8217;t pull a sled,&#8221; said Tommy.
&#8220;He&#8217;s too little. Besides, he ain&#8217;t an Eskimo
dog&mdash;I mean he isn&#8217;t,&#8221; he corrected
quickly, seeing Santa Claus look at him.
&#8220;But he&#8217;s awful bad after cats.&#8221; Just then,
to his horror, he saw Sate in the show-case
with his eye on a big, white cat. He could
hardly keep from crying out; but he called
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
to him very quietly, &#8220;Come here, come
here, Sate. Don&#8217;t you hear me, sir?
Come here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was just about to go up and seize
him when Santa Claus said: &#8220;He&#8217;s all
right. He&#8217;s just getting acquainted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My! how much he talks like Peake,&#8221;
thought Tommy. &#8220;I wonder if he is his
uncle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Just then Sate began to nose among some
little brownish-gray dogs, and so, Tommy
called, &#8220;Here&mdash;come here&mdash;come along,&#8221;
and out walked not only Sate, but six other
dogs, and stood in a line just as though they
were hitched to a sled, the six finest Eskimo
dogs Tommy had ever seen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t they beauties!&#8221; said Santa Claus.
&#8220;I never saw a finer lot; big-boned, broad-backed,
husky fellows. They&#8217;ll scale an
ice-mountain like my reindeer. And if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
they ever get in sight of a bear!&#8221; He made
a gesture as much as to say, &#8220;Let him look
out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are their names?&#8221; said Tommy,
who always wanted to know every one&#8217;s
name.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Buster and Muster and Fluster, and
Joe and Rob and Mac.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t one of them named Towser?&#8221;
asked Tommy. &#8220;I thought one was always
named Towser.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s a book-name,&#8221; said Santa
Claus so scornfully that Tommy was sorry
he had asked him, especially as he added,
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t, not ain&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But they haint any harness,&#8221; said Tommy,
using the word Peake always used,&mdash;&#8220;I
mean, hisn&#8217;t any&mdash;no, I mean haven&#8217;t
any harness. I wish I had some harness
for them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! wishing doesn&#8217;t do anything by
itself,&#8221; said Santa Claus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I tell you. I&#8217;ve a lot of string
that came off some Christmas things
my mother got for some poor people. I
put it in my pocket to give it to Johnny
to mend his goat-harness with, and I
never thought of it when I saw him last
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; said Santa Claus. &#8220;That&#8217;s better.
Let&#8217;s see it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tommy felt in his pocket, and at first he
could not find it. &#8220;I&#8217;ve lost it,&#8221; he said
sorrowfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try again,&#8221; said Santa Claus.
</p>
<p>Tommy felt again in a careless sort of
way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve lost it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It must
have dropped out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re always losing something,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
Santa Claus. &#8220;Now, Johnny would have
used that. You are sure you had it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tommy nodded. &#8220;Sure; I put it right
in this pocket.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve got it now. Feel in your
other pockets.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve felt there two times,&#8221; said Tommy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then feel again,&#8221; said Santa Claus.
And Tommy felt again, and sure enough,
there it was. He pulled it out, and as it
came it turned to harness&mdash;six sets of wonderful
dog-harness, made of curious leather-thongs,
and on every breast-strap was the
name of the dog.
</p>
<p>As Tommy made a dive for it and began
to put the harness on the dogs, Santa Claus
said, &#8220;String on bundles bought for others
sometimes comes in quite handy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Even then Tommy did not know how to
put the harness on the dogs. As fast as he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
got it on one, Sate would begin to play with
him and he would get all tangled up in it.
Tommy could have cried with shame, but
he remembered what his father had told
him about, &#8220;Trying instead of crying&#8221;; so
he kept on, and the first thing he knew they
were all harnessed. Just then he heard a
noise behind him and there was Johnny
with another team of dogs just like his,
hitched to his box-sled, on which they had
come, and on it a great pile of things tied,
and in his hand a list of what he had&mdash;food
of all kinds in little cans; bread and butter,
and even cake, like that he had given away;
dried beef; pemmican; coffee and tea, all
put up in little cases; cooking utensils; a
frying-pan and a coffee-pot and a few other
things&mdash;tin-cups and so forth; knives and
everything that he had read that boys had
when they went camping, matches and a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
flint-stone in a box with tinder, in case the
matches gave out or got wet; hatchets and
saws and tools to make ice-houses or to
mend their sleds with, in fact, everything
that Tommy&#8217;s father had ever told him
men used when they went into the woods.
And on top of all, in cases, was the ammunition
they would need.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if we had a tent,&#8221; said Johnny.
But Santa Claus said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need
tents up there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Tommy. &#8220;You sleep in
bags made of skin or in houses made of snow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Santa Claus gave Johnny a wink. &#8220;That
boy is improving,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He knows
some things;&#8221; and with that he took out
of the case and gave both Tommy and
Johnny big heavy coats of whitish fur and
two bags made of skin. &#8220;And now,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;you will have to be off if you want to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
get back here before I leave, for though the
night is very long, I must be getting away
soon,&#8221; and all of a sudden the door opened
and there was the North Star straight ahead,
and at a whistle from Santa Claus away
went the dogs, one sled right behind the
other, and Sate, galloping for life and
barking with joy, alongside.
</p>
<p>The last thing Tommy heard Santa Claus
say was, &#8220;Load right, aim right, and shoot
right; and stand your ground.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a short time they were out of the light
of the buildings and on a great treeless
waste of snow and ice, much rougher than
anything Tommy had ever seen; where it
was almost dark and the ice seemed to turn
up on edge. They had to work their way
along slowly between jagged ice-peaks,
and sometimes they came to places which it
seemed they could never get over, but by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
dint of pushing and hauling and pulling,
they always got over in the end. The first
meal they took was only a bite, because
they did not want to waste time, and they
were soon on their sleds again, dashing
along, and Tommy was glad, when, after
some hours of hard work, Johnny said he
thought they had better turn in, as in a few
hours they ought to be where Santa Claus
had told them they could find polar bears,
and they ought to be fresh when they struck
their tracks. They set to work, unhitched
the dogs, untied the packs and got out their
camp-outfit, and having dug a great hole in
the snow behind an ice-peak, where the wind
did not blow so hard, and having gathered
some dry wood, which seemed to have been
caught in the ice as if on purpose for them,
they lit a fire, and getting out their frying-pan
they stuck two chops on sticks and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
toasted them, and had the best supper
Tommy had ever eaten. The bones they
gave to the dogs. Johnny suggested tying
up the dogs, but Tommy was so sleepy, he
said: &#8220;Oh, no, they won&#8217;t go away. Besides,
suppose a bear should come while we are
asleep.&#8221; They took their guns so as to be
ready in case a polar bear should come
nosing around, and each one crawled into
his bag and was soon fast asleep, Sate having
crawled into Tommy&#8217;s bag with him
and snuggled up close to keep him warm.
</p>
<p>It seemed to Tommy only a minute before
he heard Johnny calling, and he
crawled out to find him looking around in
dismay. Every dog had disappeared except
Sate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are lost!&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;We must
try to get back or we shall freeze to death.&#8221;
He climbed up on top of an ice-peak and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
looked around in every direction; but not
a dog was in sight. &#8220;We must hurry up,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and go back after them. Why
didn&#8217;t we tie them last night! We must
take something to eat with us.&#8221; So they
set to work and got out of the bag all they
could carry, and with their guns and ammunition
were about to start back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must hide the rest of the things in
a cache,&#8221; said Tommy, &#8220;so that if we ever
come back we may find them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a cache?&#8221; said Johnny.
</p>
<p>Tommy was proud that he knew something
Johnny did not know. He explained
that a &#8220;cache&#8221; was a hiding-place.
</p>
<p>So they put the things back in the bag
and covered them up with snow, and
Tommy, taking up his gun and pack, gave a
whistle to Sate, who was nosing around. Suddenly
the snow around began to move, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
out from under the snow appeared first the
head of one dog and then of another, until
every one&mdash;Buster and Muster and Fluster
and the rest&mdash;had come up and stood shaking
himself to get the snow out of his coat.
Then Tommy remembered that his father
had told him that that was the way the
Eskimo dogs often kept themselves warm
when they slept, by boring down deep in
the snow. Never were two boys more
delighted. In a jiffy they had uncovered
the sled, eaten breakfast, fed the dogs and
hitched them up again, and were once more
on their way. They had not gone far,
though it seemed to Tommy a long, long
way, when the ice in the distance seemed
to Tommy to turn to great mountain-like
icebergs. &#8220;That&#8217;s where they are,&#8221; said
Tommy. &#8220;They are always on icebergs
in the pictures.&#8221; Feeling sure that they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
must be near them, they tied their dogs to
the biggest blocks of ice they could find, and
even tied Sate, and taking each his gun and
a bag of extra ammunition, they started
forward on foot. As Tommy&#8217;s ammunition
was very heavy, he was glad when Johnny
offered to carry it for him. Even so, they
had not gone very far, though it seemed far
enough to Tommy, when he proposed turning
back and getting something to eat. As
they turned they lost the North Star, and
when they looked for it again they could not
tell which it was. Johnny thought it was
one, Tommy was sure it was another.
So they tried first one and then the other,
and finally gave themselves up as lost.
They went supperless to bed that night or
rather that time, and Tommy never wished
himself in bed at home so much, or said his
prayers harder, or prayed for the poor more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
earnestly. They were soon up again and
were working along through the ice-peaks,
growing hungrier and hungrier, when, going
over a rise of ice, they saw not far off a little
black dot on the snow which they thought
might be bear or seal. With gun in hand
they crept along slowly and watchfully, and
soon they got close enough to see that there
was a little man, an Eskimo, armed with a
spear and bow and arrows and with four or
five dogs and a rough little sled, something
like Johnny&#8217;s sled, but with runners made of
frozen salmon. At first he appeared rather
afraid of them, but they soon made signs to
him that they were friends and were lost
and very hungry. With a grin which
showed his white teeth he pointed to his
runners, and borrowing Tommy&#8217;s knife,
he clipped a piece off of them for each of
them and handed it back with the knife;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
Tommy knew that he ought not to eat with
his knife, but he was so hungry that he
thought it would be overlooked. Having
breakfasted on frozen runner, they were
fortunate enough to make the Eskimo
understand that they wanted to find a polar
bear. He made signs to them to follow him
and he would guide them where they would
find one. &#8220;Can you shoot?&#8221; he asked,
making a sign with his bow and arrow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we shoot!&#8221; laughed both Tommy
and Johnny. &#8220;Watch us. See that big
green piece of ice there?&#8221; They pointed
at an ice-peak near by. &#8220;Well, watch us!&#8221;
And first Johnny and then Tommy blazed
away at it, and the way the icicles came
clattering down satisfied them. They wished
all that trip that the ice-peak had been a
bear. So they followed him, and a great
guide he was. He showed them how to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
avoid the rough places in the ice-fields, and,
in fact, seemed quite as much at home in
that waste of ice and snow as Johnny was
back in town.
</p>
<p>He always kept near the coast, he said, as
he could find both bear and seal there.
They had reached a very rough place,
when, as they were going along, he stopped
suddenly and pointed far off across the ice.
Neither Tommy nor Johnny could see anything
except ice and snow, try as they
might. But they understood from his excitement
that somewhere in the distance
was a seal or possibly even a polar bear
and, gun in hand, with beating hearts, they
followed him as he stole carefully through
the ice-peaks, working his way along, and
every now and then cautioning them to
stoop so as not to be seen.
</p>
<p>So they crept along until they reached
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
the foot of a high ridge of ice piled up below
a long ledge of black rock which seemed to
rise out of the frozen sea. Up this they
worked their way, stooping low, the guide
in front, clutching his bow and arrow,
Johnny next, clutching his gun, and Tommy
behind, clutching his, each treading in the
other&#8217;s tracks. Suddenly, as he neared the
top, the guide dropped flat on the snow.
Johnny followed his example and Tommy
did the same. They knew that they must
be close to the bear and they held their
breath; for the guide, having examined his
bow and arrows carefully, began to wriggle
along on his stomach. Johnny and Tommy
wriggled along behind him, clutching their
guns. Just at the top of the ledge the guide
quietly slipped an arrow out of his quiver
and held it in his hand, as he slowly raised
his head and peeped over. Johnny and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
Tommy, guns in hand, crept up beside him
to peep also. At that instant, however, before
Tommy could see anything, the guide
sprang to his feet. &#8220;Whiz,&#8221; by Tommy&#8217;s
ear went an arrow at a great white object
towering above them at the entrance of
what seemed a sort of cave, and two more
arrows followed it, whizzing by his ear
so quickly that they were all three sticking
in deep before Tommy took in that the
object was a great white polar bear, with
his head turned from them, in the act of
going in the cave. As the arrows struck him,
he twisted himself and bit savagely at them,
breaking off all but one, which was lodged
back of his shoulder. As he reared up on
his hind legs and tried to get at this arrow,
he seemed to Tommy as high as the great
wardrobe at home. Tommy, however, had
no time to do much thinking, for in twisting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
around the bear caught sight of them. As
he turned toward them, the guide with a
yell that sounded like &#8220;Look out!&#8221; dodged
behind, but both Tommy and Johnny threw
up their guns and pulled the trigger. What
was their horror to find that they both had
forgotten to load their guns after showing
the guide how they could shoot. The next
second, with jaws wide open, the bear made
a dash for them. Tommy&#8217;s heart leapt into
his throat. He glanced around to see if he
could run and climb a tree, for he knew that
grizzlies could not climb, and he hoped that
polar bears could not climb either, while
Tommy prided himself on climbing and
had often climbed the apple-tree in the
pasture at home; but there was not a tree
or a shrub in sight, and all he saw was the
little guide running for life and disappearing
behind an ice-peak.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Run, Johnny!&#8221; cried Tommy, and,
&#8220;Run, Tommy!&#8221; cried Johnny at the same
moment. But they had no time to run, for
the next second the bear was upon them,
his eyes glaring, his great teeth gleaming,
his huge jaws wide open, from which came
a growl that shook the ice under their feet.
As the bear sprang for them Johnny was
more directly in his way, but, happily, his
foot slipped from under him and he fell
flat on his back just as the bear lit, or he
would have been crushed instantly. Even
as it was, he was stunned and lay quite still
under the bear, which for the moment
seemed to be dazed. Either he could not
tell what had become of Johnny, or else he
could not make up his mind whether to eat
Johnny up at once or to leave him and
catch Tommy first and then eat them both
together. He seemed to decide on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
latter, for, standing up, he fixed his eyes on
Tommy and took a step across Johnny&#8217;s
prostrate body, with his mouth open wider
than before, his eyes glaring more fiercely,
and with a roar and a growl that made the
ice-peaks shed a shower of icicles. Then it
was that Tommy seemed to have become a
different boy. In fact, no sooner had
Johnny gone down than Tommy forgot all
about himself and his own safety, and
thought only of Johnny and how he could
save him. And, oh, how sorry he was
that he had let Johnny carry all the ammunition,
even though it was heavy! For
his gun was empty and Johnny had every
cartridge. Tommy was never so scared
in all his life. He tried to cry out, but
his throat was parched, so he began to
say his prayers, and remembering what
Santa Claus had said about boys who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
asked only for themselves, he tried to pray
for Johnny.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<img src='images/c005.jpg' width='400' height='605' alt='' title='' /><br />
<span class='caption'>
What was their horror to find that they both had forgotten<br />
to load their guns.
<br />
</span>
</div>

<p>At this moment happened what appeared
almost a miracle. By Tommy dashed a
little hairy ball and flew at the bear like
a tiger; and there was Sate, a part of his
rope still about his neck, clinging to the
bear for life. The bear deliberately stopped
and looked around as if he were too surprised
to move; but Sate&#8217;s teeth were in
him, and then the efforts of the bear to
catch him were really funny. He snapped
and snarled and snarled and snapped; but
Sate was artful enough to dodge him, and
the bear&#8217;s huge paws simply beat the air
and knocked up the snow. Do what he
might, he could not touch Sate. Finally the
bear did what bears always do when bees
settle on them when they are robbing their
hives&mdash;he began to roll over and over, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
the more he rolled the more he tied himself
up in the rope around Sate. As he rolled
away from Johnny, Tommy dashed forward
and picked up Johnny&#8217;s gun, coolly loaded
it, loading it right, too, and, springing forward,
raised the gun to his shoulder. The
bear, however, rolled so rapidly that Tommy
was afraid he might shoot Sate, and before
he could fire, the bear, with Sate still clinging
to him, rolled inside the mouth of the
cave. Tommy was in despair. At this
moment, however, he heard a sound, and
there was Johnny just getting on his feet.
He had never been so glad to see any one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the bear?&#8221; asked Johnny,
looking around, still a little dazed. Tommy
pointed to the cave.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In there, with Sate tied to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must save him,&#8221; said Johnny.
</p>
<p>Carefully dividing the ammunition now,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
both boys loaded their guns, and hurrying
down the icy slope, carefully approached
the mouth of the cave, guns in hand, in
case the bear should appear.
</p>
<p>Inside it was so dark that they could at
first see nothing, but they could hear the
sound of the struggle going on between
Sate and the bear. Suddenly Sate changed
his note and gave a little cry as of pain.
At the sound of his distress Tommy forgot
himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Follow me!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;He is choking!&#8221;
and not waiting even to look behind
to see whether Johnny was with him, he
dashed forward into the cave, gun in hand,
thinking only to save Sate. Stumbling and
slipping, he kept on, and turning a corner
there right in front of him were the two
eyes of the bear, glaring in the darkness like
coals of fire. Pushing boldly up and aiming
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
straight between the two eyes, Tommy
pulled the trigger. With a growl which
mingled with the sound of the gun, the bear
made a spring for him and fell right at his
feet, rolled up in a great ball. Happily for
Sate, he lit just on top of the ball. Tommy
whipped out his knife and cut the cord
from about Sate&#8217;s throat, and had him in
his arms when Johnny came up.
</p>
<p>The next thing was to skin the bear, and
this the boys expected to find as hard work
as ever even Johnny had done; but, fortunately,
the bear had been so surprised at
Tommy&#8217;s courage and skill in aiming that
when the bullet hit him he had almost
jumped out of his skin. So, after they had
worked a little while, the skin came off
quite easily. What surprised Johnny was
that it was all tanned, but Tommy had
always rather thought that bears wore their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
skin tanned on the inside and lined, too.
The next thing was to have a dinner of bear-meat,
for, as Tommy well remembered, all
bear-hunters ate bear-steaks. They were
about to go down to the shore to hunt along
for driftwood, when, their eyes becoming
accustomed to the darkness, they found a
pile of wood in the corner of the cave, which
satisfied them that at some time in the past
this cave had been used by robbers or pirates,
who probably had been driven away by this
great bear, or possibly might even have been
eaten up by him.
</p>
<p>At first they had some little difficulty in
making a fire, as their matches, warranted
water-proof, had all got damp when Tommy
fell into the water&mdash;an incident I forgot
to mention; but after trying and trying,
the tinder caught from the flint and they
quickly had a fine fire crackling in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
corner of the cave, and here they cooked
bear-steak and had the finest dinner they
had had since they came into the Arctic
Regions. They were just thinking of going
after the dogs and the sleds, when up came
the dogs dragging the sleds behind them,
and without a word, pitched in to make a
hearty meal of bear-meat themselves. It
seemed as if they had got a whiff of the
fresh steak and pulled the sleds loose from the
ice points to which they were fastened. They
were not, however, allowed to eat in any
peace until they had all recognized that
Sate was the hero of this bear fight, for
he gave himself as many airs as though he
had not only got the bear, but had shot and
skinned it.
</p>
<p>It was at this moment that the Eskimo
guide came back, jabbering with delight,
and with his white teeth shining, just as if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
he had been as brave as Sate. At first,
Tommy and Johnny were inclined to be
very cold to him and pointed their fingers
at him as a coward, but when he said he
had only one arrow left and had wanted
that to get a sealskin coat for Tommy&#8217;s
mother, and, as he had the sealskin coat,
they could not contradict him, but graciously
gave him, in exchange for the coat,
the bear-meat which the dogs had not eaten.
</p>
<p>Having packed everything on the sled
carefully, with the sealskin coat on top of
the pack and the bear&#8217;s fur on top of that,
and having bid their Eskimo friend good-by,
they turned their backs on the North
Pole and struck out for home.
</p>
<p>They had hardly started, however, when
the sound of sleigh-bells reached them,
coming from far over the snow, and before
they could tell where it was, who should
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
appear, sailing along over the ice-peaks, but
Santa Claus himself, in his own sleigh, all
packed with Christmas things, his eight
reindeer shining in the moonlight and his
bells jingling merrily. Such a shout as he
gave when he found that they had actually
got the bear and had the robe to show for
it! It did them good; and both Tommy
and Johnny vied with each other in telling
what the other had done. Santa Claus was
so pleased that he made them both get in his
sleigh to tell him about it. He let Sate get
in too, and snuggle down right at their
feet. Johnny&#8217;s box-sled he hitched on behind.
The dogs were turned loose. At
first Tommy feared they might get lost,
but Santa Claus said they would soon find
their way home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact,&#8221; he said with a wink, &#8220;you
have not been so far away as you think.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
Now tell me all about it,&#8221; he said. So
Tommy began to tell him, beginning at the
very beginning when Johnny took him on
his sled. But he had only got as far as the
sofa, when he fell asleep, and he never knew
how he got back home. When he waked
up he was in bed.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>He never could recall exactly what happened.
Afterward he recalled Santa Claus
saying to him, &#8220;You must show me where
Johnny lives, for I&#8217;m afraid I forgot him last
Christmas.&#8221; Then he remembered that
once he heard Santa Claus calling to him in
a whisper, &#8220;Tommy Trot, Tommy Trot,&#8221;
and though he was very sleepy he raised
himself up to find Santa Claus standing up
in the sled in Johnny&#8217;s backyard, with
Johnny fast asleep in his arms; and that
Santa Claus said to him, &#8220;I want to put
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
Johnny in bed without waking him up, and
I want you to follow me, and put these
things which I have piled up here on the
sled you made for him, in his stocking by
the fire.&#8221; He remembered that at a whistle
to the deer they sprang with a bound to the
roof, the sled sailing behind them; but how
he got down he never could recall, and he
never knew how he got back home.

<p>When he waked next morning there was
the polar bearskin which he and Johnny
had brought back with them, not to mention
the sealskin coat, and though Johnny,
when he next saw him, was too much excited
at first by his new sled and the fine
fresh cow which his mother had found in
her cow-house that morning, to talk about
anything else, yet, when he and his mother
came over after breakfast to see Tommy&#8217;s
father and thank him for something, they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
said that Santa Claus had paid them a visit
such as he never had paid before, and they
brought with them Johnny&#8217;s goats, which
they insisted on giving Tommy as a Christmas
present. So Tommy Trot knew that
Santa Claus had got his letter.
